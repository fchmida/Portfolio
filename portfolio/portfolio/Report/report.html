        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> My <a href = "https://doc.gold.ac.uk/~fghoz001/portfolio/index.html">website</a> portfolio is about the job that I am hoping to achieve in 10 years which is a full stack engineer. I really want to be doing both front end programming as well as back end as they both are really interesting and fun for me. My site gives information on what I want to do in 10 years time as well as some examples of what I could be doing in the future.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My audience is to potentinal employees, students interested in the subject/career as well as people who are curious and are interested about what being a software engineer means and what the job includes and has to offer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href = "https://azumbrunnen.me/">Portfolio 1</a> I really like the presentation of this website as it is a simple and minimal design. It's easy to read and accessible because of the contrasting colours, in this instance, black and white. It is very eye catching because of the contrasting colours and has a clean font which is easy to read. They have good use of images to present their work and good use of interaction buttons to display examples of their work.</li>
          <li> <a href = "https://www.michelleovalle.com/">Portfolio 2</a> I like the simplicity of the layout and design. It is easy to read and accessible as it has a clear contrast in colours and a clean font. However, it is really plain as they have no images and the colours they have used are boring to me.</li>
          <li> <a href = "https://www.onyedika.xyz/">Portfolio 3</a> This website is very unique and eye catching as it has a different look compared to most other portfolio websites I've visited. It's easy to read due to the bold and coloured font contrast. They have a clear theme going on using the colours black, white and green. The bubbly font also makes it eye catching and unique. They have used images and animations/drawings to differentiate their work from others. I really like the animations of the buttons and how they used it to display examples of their work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have a nav bar which displays all the webpages I have and can easily be accessed by clicking on the name of the webpage you want to go to.</li>
          <li>I've used clean fonts so people can read what I've written clearly.</li>
          <li>I've added a footer with links to my other webpages and social media for easy access.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Learning</p>
        <p>I've used w3schools to get an understanding of CSS and HTML. I specifically needed help on how to make the navigation and using this website really helped me as it explained it in the basics. I looked at the example and modified it to my needs. I've also used Youtube to animate parts of my website and modified it to my liking, using this <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs">video.</a> I used another <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-5LpaN2LF8">video</a> to add social media links and modified it to what I needed.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3> I think the footer has worked really well as I really like the design and it is easily accesible to view the social media platforms I've linked and my other webpages. I also like how when you hover over the navigation it highlights so you can tell what your clicking on. I also like the design of my homepage as it has a nice design and is simple.</h3>
          <ul>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3> I could add more animations to make the website flow better and make it more interesting. I could also use a custom font to make it more unique and stand out.</h3>
